# peps_excitation
### A tensor network library for two-dimensional excitation
by Wei-Lin Tu

\
peps-excitation utilizes the ground state ansatz generated by [peps-torch](https://github.com/jurajHasik/tn-torch_dev) and calculates the excitation ansatz combining the usage of generating function *([PhysRevB.103.205155](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.205155)) in two dimensions. 
optimization of infinite Projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) 
by direct energy minimization. The energy is evaluated using environments obtained 
by the corner-transfer matrix (CTM) algorithm. Afterwards, the gradients are computed by reverse-mode 
automatic differentiation (AD).

--size: the size of cluster of upper/lower (left/right) sides. The overall size is (2 * size + 2) * (2 * size + 2)

Ground state ansatz can be generated from peps-torch (https://github.com/jurajHasik/peps-torch).
